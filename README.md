# ToDo List App

A simple and interactive ToDo List web application built using **React.js**. This project allows users to manage tasks, mark them as complete, and edit or delete tasks. The tasks are stored locally using `localStorage`, so your list will persist even if the page is reloaded.

## Features

- **Add New Tasks**: Add tasks to your to-do list.
- **Mark Tasks as Completed**: Mark tasks as completed and watch them move to the bottom.
- **Edit Tasks**: Update the content of existing tasks.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks from the list.
- **Persistent Data**: Your tasks are saved in `localStorage`, so they remain even after refreshing the page.
- **Responsive Design**: Works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
